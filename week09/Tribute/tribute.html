    <h1>Tribute to Slap</h1>
    <img src="bassGuitar01.png.png" alt="" />
    <p><strong>Slap Bass</strong> has been around as we know it on the electric bass
    since Larry Graham invented it while playing with Sly and the Family Stone, but has
    technically been around since the rockabilly players slapping on the double bass.</p>
    <p>So what does slapping the bass mean, technically? Slap bass is usually at its core comprised
    of two distinct elements. The percussive hard slap on the string with the thumb, blended with a hard
    pluck outward with either the index or middle finger called a 'pop'. This new form of playing the bass
    allowed for it to blend the rhythm and melody of a song much more fluently than had been done before. This
    new technique made the perfect debut in the psychadelic funk era it was born, and has remained a staple of
    the funk sound even today.</p>
    <p>Most people are probably familiar with Flee from the Red Hot Chili Peppers as he is easily one
    of the most prominent slap bassists in pop culture. If it weren't for the music that him, Victor Wooten,
    Jaco Pastorius, and Joe Dart continue to produce for the masses, it's hard for me to imagine how dull
    music would sound.</p>
